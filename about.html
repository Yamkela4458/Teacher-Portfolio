    <h1>About Me...</h1>

    <h4>
      From the very beginning, I knew that I wanted to make a difference
      in the lives of young learners. Growing up in a community where 
      education was both a challenge and a key to opportunity, I developed 
      a deep appreciation for the power of learning, and an even deeper desire 
      to become the kind of teacher I once needed. That journey led me to 
      pursue my Bachelor of Education in Foundation Phase Teaching at Walter
      Sisulu University, where I immersed myself in understanding how children
      grow, learn, and thrive.
    </h4>

    <h4>
      During my undergraduate years, I quickly discovered a special passion for 
      literacy. I was fascinated by how a single storybook could spark imagination, 
      how phonics could unlock entire worlds for a child, and how a patient teacher 
      could turn confusion into confidence. It wasn’t just about reading and writing—it 
      was about empowering children with the tools to understand and express themselves. 
      I began crafting creative lessons, experimenting with storytelling, puppetry, and 
      digital platforms to bring language learning to life.
    </h4>

    <h4>
      After graduating in 2024, I chose not to stop there. Fueled by a desire to deepen my 
      expertise, I enrolled in an Honours Degree in Language, Literacy & Literature at the
      University of Johannesburg. This program has opened my eyes to advanced pedagogical 
      theories, research practices, and the socio-cultural dynamics of language acquisition. 
      It has also pushed me to think critically and innovatively about the role of literacy 
      in a rapidly changing world.
    </h4>

    <h4>
      But what truly sets my journey apart is my integration of technology and education. I 
      believe that the future of teaching lies at the intersection of heart and hardware, where 
      compassion meets code. To prepare for this future, I earned a TEFL certification and pursued 
      cutting-edge courses like Artificial Intelligence in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, also from 
      the University of Johannesburg. These experiences have equipped me not just to teach, but to lead 
      in modern classrooms that are hybrid, inclusive, and digitally enriched.
    </h4>

    <h4>
      Today, I am not just an educator, I am a lifelong learner, a digital pioneer, and a literacy advocate 
      committed to nurturing young minds with curiosity, creativity, and care. My mission is to empower 
      the next generation with the skills, confidence, and vision they need to thrive because every child 
      deserves a champion who believes in them, even before they believe in themselves.
